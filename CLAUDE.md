# Glasscast – AI-First iOS Weather App

This project demonstrates AI-assisted iOS development using SwiftUI and MVVM.

## Tech Stack
- SwiftUI
- MVVM Architecture
- Supabase (Auth + Database with RLS)
- OpenWeatherMap API

## AI Workflow Guidelines
- Use AI as the primary coding assistant (Claude / Cursor)
- Follow MVVM strictly (Views are UI-only)
- Use async/await
- Avoid force unwraps
- Handle loading and error states explicitly
- Do not hardcode secrets or API keys
- Prefer clarity over cleverness

## Development Approach
- Start with clean architecture
- Build features incrementally
- Let AI generate drafts, then refine manually
- Debug and correct AI mistakes thoughtfully
